\chapter{Introduction}
Theses are rumoured to be the capstones of education, so I decided
to write one of my own. If all goes well, I will soon have a
diploma under my belt. Wish me luck!
Possible other chapters to explain terms: journaling filesystem, allocation groups, B+ trees

\chapter{Targeted filesystems}
\section{XFS}

XFS is a 64-bit journaling file system created by Silicon Graphics, Inc(SGI) in 1993. It is known for excellence in execution of paralel I/O operations, because of its architecture based on allocation groups.

Allocation groups are euqally sized linear regions within file system. Each allocation group manages its own inodes and free space, therefore increasing parallelism.
Architecture of this design enables for significant scalability of bandwidth, threads, and size of filesystem, as well as its files, simply because multiple processes and threads can access the file system simultaneously.

XFS allocates space as extents stored in pairs of B+ trees, each pair for each allocation group (imrpoving performance especially when handling large files). One of the B+ trees is indexed by the length of the free extents, while the other is indexed by the starting block of the free extents. This dual indexing scheme allows for the highly efficient location of free extents for file system operations.
Extent describes one or more contiguous blocks, which can considerably shorten list of blocks.
 
Metadata journaling ensures consistency of data in case of emergency situations as f.e. system crash.

Prevention of file system fragmentation consist mainly of \textit{delayed allocation} feature as well as online defragmentation(\textit{xfs\_fsr}), that can. 

Delayed allocation, also called \textit{allocate-on-flush} is a feature that, when a file is written to the buffer cache, substracts space from the free-space counter, but won't allocate the free-space bitmap. The data is held in memory, instead, until it must be flushed (to storage) because of memory pressure when calling Unix \textit{sync}, or when flushing dirty buffers. This approach improves the chance, that the file will be written in a contiguous group of blocks, avoiding fragmentation and reducing CPU usage as well.

If your reference points to a place that has not yet been typeset,
the \verb"\ref" command will expand to \textbf{??} during the first
run of
\texttt{pdflatex \jobname.tex}
and a second run is going to be needed for the references to
resolve. With online services -- such as Overleaf -- this is
performed automatically.

\chapter{Mathematical equations}
\label{chap:matheq}
\TeX{} comes pre-packed with the ability to typeset inline
equations, such as $\mathrm{e}^{ix}=\cos x+i\sin x$, and display
equations, such as \[
  \mathbf{A}^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}
  a & b \\ c & d \\
  \end{bmatrix}^{-1} =
  \frac{1}{\det(\mathbf{A})} \begin{bmatrix}
  \,\,\,d & \!\!-b \\ -c & \,a \\
  \end{bmatrix} =
  \frac{1}{ad - bc} \begin{bmatrix}
  \,\,\,d & \!\!-b \\ -c & \,a \\
  \end{bmatrix}.
\] \LaTeX{} defines the automatically numbered \texttt{equation}
environment:
\begin{equation}
  \gamma Px = PAx = PAP^{-1}Px.
\end{equation}
The package \textsf{amsmath} provides several additional
environments that can be used to typeset complex equations:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item An equation can be spread over multiple lines using the
    \texttt{multline} environment:
    \begin{multline}
      a + b + c + d + e + f + b + c + d + e + f + b + c + d + e +
f \\
      + f + g + h + i + j + k + l + m + n + o + p + q
    \end{multline}

  \item Several aligned equations can be typeset using the
    \texttt{align} environment:
    \begin{align}
              a + b &= c + d     \\
                  u &= v + w + x \\[1ex]
      i + j + k + l &= m
    \end{align}

  \item The \texttt{alignat} environment is similar to
    \texttt{align}, but it doesn't insert horizontal spaces between
    the individual columns:
    \begin{alignat}{2}
      a + b + c &+ d       &   &= 0 \\
              e &+ f + g   &   &= 5
    \end{alignat}

  \item Much like chapter, sections, tables, figures, or list
    items, equations -- such as \eqref{eq:first} and
    \eqref{eq:mine} -- can also be labeled and referenced:
    \begin{alignat}{4}
      b_{11}x_1 &+ b_{12}x_2  &  &+ b_{13}x_3  &  &             &
        &= y_1,                   \label{eq:first} \\
      b_{21}x_1 &+ b_{22}x_2  &  &             &  &+ b_{24}x_4  &
        &= y_2. \tag{My equation} \label{eq:mine}
    \end{alignat}

  \item The \texttt{gather} environment makes it possible to
    typeset several equations without any alignment:
    \begin{gather}
      \psi = \psi\psi, \\
      \eta = \eta\eta\eta\eta\eta\eta, \\
      \theta = \theta.
    \end{gather}

  \item Several cases can be typeset using the \texttt{cases}
    environment:
    \begin{equation}
      |y| = \begin{cases}
        \phantom-y & \text{if }z\geq0, \\
                -y & \text{otherwise}.
      \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
For the complete list of environments and commands, consult the
\textsf{amsmath} package manual\footnote{
  See \url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/amsldoc.pdf}.
  The \texttt{\textbackslash url} command is provided by the
  package \textsf{url}.
}.

\chapter{\textnormal{We \textsf{have} \texttt{several} \textsc{fonts}
  \textit{at} \textbf{disposal}}}
The serified roman font is used for the main body of the text.
\textit{Italics are typically used to denote emphasis or
quotations.} \texttt{The teletype font is typically used for source
code listings.} The \textbf{bold}, \textsc{small-caps} and
\textsf{sans-serif} variants of the base roman font can be used to
denote specific types of information.

\tiny We \scriptsize can \footnotesize also \small change \normalsize
the \large font \Large size, \LARGE although \huge it \Huge
is \huge usually \LARGE not \Large necessary.\normalsize

A wide variety of mathematical fonts is also available, such as: \[
  \mathrm{ABC}, \mathcal{ABC}, \mathbf{ABC}, \mathsf{ABC},
  \mathit{ABC}, \mathtt{ABC}
\] By loading the \textsf{amsfonts} packages, several additional
fonts will become available: \[
  \mathfrak{ABC}, \mathbb{ABC}
\] Many other mathematical fonts are available\footnote{
  See \url{http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/58124/70941}.
}.

\chapter{Inserting the bibliography}
After loading the \texttt{biblatex} package and linking a
bibliography data\-base file to the document using the
\verb"\addbibresource" command, you can start citing the entries.
This is just dummy text \cite{inbook-full} lightly sprinkled with
citations \cite[p.~123]{incollection-full}.  Several sources can be
cited at once \cite{whole-collection, manual-minimal,manual-full}.
\citetitle{inbook-full} was written by \citeauthor{inbook-full} in
\citeyear{inbook-full}. We can also produce \textcite{inbook-full}
or%% Let us define a compound command:
\def\citeauthoryear#1{(\textcite{#1},~\citeyear{#1})}
\citeauthoryear{inbook-full}. The full bibliographic citation is:
\emph{\fullcite{inbook-full}}. We can easily insert a bibliographic
citation into the footnote\footfullcite{inbook-full}.

The \verb"\nocite" command will not generate any
output\nocite{booklet-full}, but it will insert its argument into
the bibliography. The \verb"\nocite{*}" command will insert all the
records in the bibliography database file into the bibliography.
Try uncommenting the command
%% \nocite{*}
and watch the bibliography section come apart at the seams.

When typesetting the document for the first time, citing a
\texttt{work} will expand to [\textbf{work}] and the
\verb"\printbibliography" command will produce no output. It is now
necessary to generate the bibliography by running \texttt{biber
\jobname.bcf} from the command line and then by typesetting the
document again twice. During the first run, the bibliography
section and the citations will be typeset, and in the second run,
the bibliography section will appear in the table of contents.

The \texttt{biber} command needs to be executed from within the
directory, where the \LaTeX\ source file is located. In Windows,
the command line can be opened in a directory by holding down the
\keys{Shift} key and by clicking the right mouse button while
hovering the cursor over a directory.  Select the \menu{Open
Command Window Here} option in the context menu that opens shortly
afterwards.

With online services -- such as Overleaf -- all commands are
executed automatically.

{\csname captions\languagename\endcsname %% Temporarily override
%% the BibLaTeX localization with the original babel definitions.
\makeatletter %% Use the correct localization of the quotations.
  \thesis@selectLocale{\thesis@locale}\makeatother
\printbibliography[heading=bibintoc]} %% Print the bibliography.

\chapter{Inserting the index}
After using the \verb"\makeindex" macro and loading the
\texttt{makeidx} package that provides additional indexing
commands, index entries can be created by issuing the \verb"\index"
command. \index{dummy text|(}It is possible to create ranged index
entries, which will encompass a span of text.\index{dummy text|)}
To insert complex typographic material -- such as $\alpha$
\index{alpha@$\alpha$} or \TeX{} \index{TeX@\TeX} --
into the index, you need to specify a text string, which will
determine how the entry will be sorted. It is also possible to
create hierarchal entries. \index{vehicles!trucks}
\index{vehicles!speed cars}

After typesetting the document, it is necessary to generate the
index by running
\begin{center}%
  \texttt{texindy -I latex -C utf8 -L }$\langle$\textit{locale}%
  $\rangle$\texttt{ \jobname.idx}
\end{center}
from the command line, where $\langle$\textit{locale}$\rangle$
corresponds to the main locale of your thesis -- such as
\texttt{english}, and then typesetting the document again.

The \texttt{texindy} command needs to be executed from within the
directory, where the \LaTeX\ source file is located. In Windows,
the command line can be opened in a directory by holding down the
\keys{Shift} key and by clicking the right mouse button while
hovering the cursor over a directory. Select the \menu{Open Command
Window Here} option in the context menu that opens shortly
afterwards.

With online services -- such as Overleaf -- the commands are
executed automatically, although the locale may be erroneously
detected, or the \texttt{makeindex} tool (which is only able to
sort entries that contain digits and letters of the English
alphabet) may be used instead of \texttt{texindy}. In either case,
the index will be ill-sorted.
