= Drift job =

== 1. Description ==

Drift job is a simple beaker job to run fs-drift <bengland@redhat.com> on a file system.

To successfully execute a task, you have to already have your device and file system configured. The runtest.sh script takes only one argument, which is a string of fs-drift parameters.

Example:
runtest.sh "-t /lun2 -d 500 -f 1000 -s 4096"

The output is called drift.log, which is by default sent to beaker and it contains fs-drift output as well as df command output.

== 2. fs-drift ==

fs-drift is a file system ageing test designed to run mixed workload on a file system.

The ratio of executed operations is:

 * read,10
 * create,30
 * append,60
 * delete,5
 * rename,1

This is specified in my_workload.csv file, if you want to have different distribution fork the drift_job and either edit that file, or create a new one and refer it in multi_thread_config.sh.

If you want to fill a file system, follow instructions:

'To fill up a filesystem, just specify a --max-files and a mean file size such that the product is much greater than the filesystem's space.'
